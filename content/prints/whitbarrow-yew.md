Whitbarrow is a broad limestone plateau in the South Lakes. It has a squat, bulky form, edged with sheer cliffs on the west and gentle wooded slopes to the east. On the summit the south-westerly winds off Morecambe Bay twist the trees into expressive, contorted forms.

Larch, birch and ash are common on Whitbarrow, but one of its glories are the yew trees which cling to it's slopes and grow from cracks in the limestone pavements. Stunted and asymmetric, most of their growth occurs on the side facing away from the winds off the sea.
