Gurnal Dubs is a small tarn nestled among heather-clad fells not far from Kendal. Off the tourist trail, it is a popular destination for open-water swimming enthusiasts and families on Sunday rambles. 

Small promontories break up the shoreline, one with a stand of trees. The water is clear when undisturbed, so it is disconcerting when your feet sink into thick soft mud as you step into the water. 

A solidly built stone boathouse sits on the edge of the tarn, near a flat grassy area perfect for picnics on warm summer days.
