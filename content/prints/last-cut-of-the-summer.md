My friend Rhuari lived opposite a steep meadow in the Fellside area of Kendal. Over the years he had worked to transform a grass-dominated pasture into a diverse wildflower meadow teeming with life.

Twice a year he cut it back in the purist way with a scythe, keenly honed to sharpness with a stone. He had become skilled in the smooth sweeping rhythm needed to cut the long hay cleanly. 

Shortly after taking the sketches for this photo he moved, leaving behind the meadow as a wonderful legacy for the new owners of his house.
