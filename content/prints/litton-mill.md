Litton Mill is a small, peaceful village squeezed into the bottom of a steep-sided limestone gorge in the Peak District. I was commissioned to make this print as a present for a school friend who grew up in one of the 19th century workers' cottages in the village. 

When I visited on a rainy August day the river was in full spate and the trees were dripping with water. Looking from the bridge across the mill pond, the village appeared to be in the process of being engulfed by thick, verdant foliage.
