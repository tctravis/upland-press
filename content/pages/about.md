- title: Portraits of a human landscape
  text: "<p>Although often wild and sparsely inhabited, the uplands of northern England
    are man-made, cultural landscapes. I am interested in how people interact with
    nature to form this landscape, both in the past and present. The stone-built barns
    and walls which frame and punctuate the landscape are relics of past human labour.
    The coppiced woodland and few remaining wildflower meadows are rich natural habitats
    which depend on continued human interaction for their existence.</p><p>Whether
    images of people or landscapes, all my prints are intended as portraits, an attempt
    to capture something personal and distinctive about the subject. The challenge
    of working in the medium of small-scale, primarily black-and-white, linocuts is
    to capture this distinct, individual character within a highly simplified form,
    working with a very limited palette of marks and shapes.</p>"

- title: Keep it simple
  text: "<p>One of the things I like about linocut printmaking is how accessible and
    simple it is. Some nice, fresh art linoleum and a set of sharp tools is all that's
    needed to make a block. For printing, a sheet of smooth printmaking paper, a wooden
    spoon, a tube of ink and a roller - plus elbow grease - is all that's required.
    It is essentially a popular, democratic art form - affordable to produce and to
    buy.</p>"

- title: This is the second section
  text: "<p>For me, making a linocut print is like solving a puzzle. This is particularly
    true for small-scale black and white images. The subject, whether landscape or
    portrait, needs reducing to a bare minimum of lines and shapes. Light, dark and
    shade are suggested using a range of simple white shapes cut into a dark background.

  who work in them and the plants and wildlife who inhabit them.</p>"

It seems quite easy to add new content. Quite basic. What happens when I add an image in the text.

And we add some more text underneath.
