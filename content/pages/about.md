- title: Keep it simple
  text: "<p>One of the things I like about linocut printmaking is how accessible and
    simple it is. Some nice, fresh art linoleum and a set of sharp tools is all that's
    needed to make a block. For printing, a sheet of smooth printmaking paper, a wooden
    spoon, a tube of ink and a roller - plus elbow grease - is all that's required.
    It is essentially a popular, democratic art form - affordable to produce and to
    buy.</p>"

- title: This is the second section
  text: "<p>For me, making a linocut print is like solving a puzzle. This is particularly
    true for small-scale black and white images. The subject, whether landscape or
    portrait, needs reducing to a bare minimum of lines and shapes. Light, dark and
    shade are suggested using a range of simple white shapes cut into a dark background.

  who work in them and the plants and wildlife who inhabit them.</p>"

It seems quite easy to add new content. Quite basic. What happens when I add an image in the text.

And we add some more text underneath.
